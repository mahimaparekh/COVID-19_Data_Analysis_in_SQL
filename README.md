# COVID-19-Data-SQL-Exploration
This repository contains a collection of files and scripts focused on exploring COVID-19 data using SQL with the aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 statistics, trends, and patterns through SQL queries and data exploration techniques.

SQL Language: Microsoft SQL Server

Environment: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studion (SSMS) version 19.0.2

Project Source Files: 
* COVID_19_DATA_.csv: main file containing COVID-19 data across the globe from the 01-Jan-2020 to 14-May-2023
* CovidDeaths: excel file containing information about deaths caused by Covid-19
* CovidVaccinations: excel file containing covid vaccination information 

Project Files:
* SQL_Script.sql: a SQL script file containing queries used for data exploration and analysis to extract insights from the datasets
* Report.pdf: a detailed analysis report explaining the sql queries used and the results obtained

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Ensure you have SSMS installed on your computer or download it from here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16.
3. Open SQL Server and create a new database in SQL Server.
4. Import `CovidDeaths.xlsx` and `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` as tables
5. Open the `SQL_Script.sql` file and execute the SQL queries in your SQL Server environment. These queries will retrieve and analyze the data from the tables.

## Results and Findings 
- can be viewed in the 'Report.pdf' file

'Feel free to explore the provided SQL queries and modify them according to your requirements. The project can be further extended by incorporating additional datasets, refining the analysis, or implementing advanced statistical models.'
